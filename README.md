# running-for-it
"Running for it" is an IOS app in progress. It utilizes SwiftUI and is currently built for iPhone with a goal of expanding to WatchOS.
The app aims to allow users to track their interval workout where they alternate walking and running. The user will select times for their walking and running and the app will notify them when it is time to switch. This app allows users to track their workout by total time, or number of intervals.
I started working on this app because I wanted to build my running skills, but starting by trying to run miles without breaks was extremely frustrating. I downloaded a few running apps that were marketed as free, but then a week in I was required to pay. This is why I was inspired to build my own app. This was my first Swift project and I really enjoyed learning the language as I developed the app.
